**wip:** 2048 is still now working because of some bug



found it this weekend on HN and was a really quite fun project to do, at this point I just had been casually exposed to C programming, but even, the article was really accesible

for those interested in computer architecture, i think this project is a great introduction :)

build with:

```
gcc lc3 -o lc3
```

play 2048 with:

```
lc3 2048.obj
```
