# lc3
lc3 virtual machine project

code from (write your own virtual machine)[https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm]

found it this weekend on HN and was a really quite fun project to do, at this point I just had been casually exposed to C programming, but even, the article was really accesible

for those interested in computer architecture, i think this project is a great introduction :)

build with:

```
gcc lc3 -o lc3
```
